  üéØ Strengths

  1. Security-First Approach
  - Strong authentication (bcrypt, MFA,
  account lockout)
  - European-focused compliance (avoiding US
  providers)
  - Proper session management with JWT +
  refresh tokens
  - Rate limiting and brute force protection

  2. MCP-Centric Architecture
  - Well-structured MCP modules for each CRUD
  operation
  - Separation of concerns between file ops,
  search, and storage
  - MCP client orchestration layer for error
  handling

  3. GDPR Compliance
  - Dedicated module for data export/deletion
  - Audit trail generation
  - European infrastructure focus

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations & Recommendations

  1. Implementation Priority
  Phase 1: Core Auth + Basic CRUD
  Phase 2: MCP Modules + File Operations
  Phase 3: Advanced Features + GDPR
  Phase 4: Deployment + Monitoring

  2. Technical Concerns
  - PostgreSQL + Redis: Consider if both are
  needed initially
  - MCP Complexity: Might be over-engineered
  for MVP - could start simpler
  - European Providers: Verify
  pricing/availability for your scale

  3. Missing Elements
  - API rate limiting per user/tenant
  - File versioning strategy
  - Backup/disaster recovery plan
  - Load balancing for MCP modules

  üöÄ Implementation Readiness

  Your current monorepo structure aligns
  perfectly with this plan:
  - mcp-modules/ ‚Üí MCP protocol
  implementations
  - backend/ ‚Üí API orchestration layer
  - frontend/ ‚Üí React UI with MCP integration

  Suggested Next Steps:
  1. Start with basic auth + PostgreSQL setup
  2. Build one MCP module (file read) as proof
   of concept
  3. Add React file upload/display components
  4. Iterate and expand

  The plan is ambitious but well-thought-out.
  Consider starting with an MVP focusing on
  core file operations before implementing all
   MCP modules.
